I am grateful for my supervisor Marco Kulhmann's great guidance on my thesis. You taught me to do things with an easy start and a hard end though this thesis is not called an end. You 
always gave me feedbacks in a positive way. This indeed encouraged me a lot for working on my thesis. I would like to thank professor Mattias Villani for pushing me think neural network in a statistical way. It changed the view how I see problems in my thesis. I would like to thank my examiner Oleg Sysoev for your constructive feedback. I would like to thank my colleague Robin Kurtz for his inspiration and his advice. You are always willing to help me. I would like to thank my opponent Hector Rodriguez Deniz. You gave me as much feedback as you can. I would like to thank Malte Nalenz for his support and encouragement. We walked the journey together. Last but not least I would like to thank all the teachers and friends who I met in Sweden. You are my best memory.
